## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

 # Chromatic Clock

This project is a unique representation of time using a color-changing background. The clock runs on a 10-second cycle, where the hue of the background changes from 0 to 360 degrees on the HSB colour scale. This visual change gives an unconventional yet constant sense of time passing.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

Time is often perceived through changes in our environment. This clock visualizes time through continuous and smooth colour transitions, creating a new way to experience the passage of seconds.

# Celestial Clock

This project presents an unconventional representation of time using a dynamic display of celestial images and star patterns. The "Celestial Clock" uses a continuous cycle to display images of nebulae, black holes, and supernovas, interspersed with randomly appearing stars, to create a constantly changing visual experience.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the clock.

## Concept

The passage of time is represented through the changing and moving images of celestial objects, reflecting the ongoing cycles and transformations in the universe. Adding a starry background that evolves emphasizes the dynamic nature of space.

## Changes from Inherited Work

- Maintained the sequential display of celestial images.
- Added animated horizontal movement for images.
- Introduced a trailing effect for a more dynamic background.
- Modified star drawing to occur consistently, enhancing the visual experience.
- Enhanced image display logic to include motion and direction changes.

# Dynamic Ice Cream Stacker

This project presents a playful and interactive game where users can stack scoops of ice cream. The "Dynamic Ice Cream Stacker" allows you to add vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry scoops, with each scoop pulsating to create a dynamic visual effect. The game alerts you when the stack gets too high with a colourful screen effect and encourages you to start over.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.

## Concept

The game represents the fun and creativity of stacking ice cream scoops. The pulsing effect adds a dynamic and lively feel to the scoops, making the stacking process visually engaging. The game-over effect and interactive reset button provide a complete and enjoyable user experience.

## Changes from Inherited Work

- Maintained the button functionality for adding scoops and resetting the ice cream.
- Introduced a pulsing effect for scoops to create dynamic visuals.
- Added an array to manage and draw multiple scoops.
- Enhanced the background and scoop redrawing process for better visual engagement.
- Improved interactive elements to make the game more responsive and enjoyable.

 Stage 3 Dataset Visualization :

Iâ€™ll integrate a dataset that relates to astronomical events. For this example, letâ€™s use a dataset containing information about astronomical events (black hole sightings, supernova events, etc.). Weâ€™ll visualize this data by displaying the frequency of these events as a bar chart alongside the moving images.

Stage 3 Explanation:

	â€¢	Dataset: Integrated a simple dataset (events) representing frequencies of astronomical events.
	â€¢	Bar Chart Visualization: Added a drawBarChart function to visualize the dataset as a bar chart at the bottom of the canvas.

Iâ€™ll adapt the Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game with different pathways in this stage. Iâ€™ll incorporate key presses to navigate different game states and add narrative text to guide the player.

Game States

	â€¢	Game States: The game has multiple states (start, explore, discover, room, end) to manage different parts of the game. This helps transition between different scenes and actions.
	â€¢	Start State: The initial state where the player is welcomed and given options to explore the station or discover astronomical events.
	â€¢	Explore State: This allows players to see moving images and navigate to different rooms.
	â€¢	Discover State: Displays a bar chart showing frequencies of different events.
	â€¢	Room State: When a player enters a specific room, they can see the room name and have an option to go back.
	â€¢	End State: A simple thank-you screen to conclude the game.

Key Presses

	â€¢	Key Presses: Incorporated key presses (E, D, B, 1 to 5) to navigate different states and interact with the game.
	â€¢	E to enter the explore state.
 D` to enter the discover state.
  - `B` to go back to the previous state.
  - `1` to `5` to enter different rooms while in the explore state.

#### **Images and Movement**
- **Images and Movement:** Images move across the screen, reversing direction upon hitting the screen edge, creating a dynamic visual effect.
  
#### **Data Visualization**
- **Bar Chart:** Displays a simple bar chart in the discover state, visualizing the example dataset.

Structured games this way allow for a seamless and interactive experience, transitioning between narrative-driven exploration and data visualization and creating a more engaging and immersive experience for the player.

Living Environment and Interactive Game:

	â€¢	Living Environment: Reimagined the ice cream creation process as an interactive game where players can create ice cream cones by selecting different flavours.
	â€¢	Interactive Gameplay: Players interact with the game by clicking buttons to add scoops of ice cream. The game responds to these interactions by changing the appearance of the ice cream cone and updating the game state.
	â€¢	Narrative Elements: Incorporated a narrative element with game states (start, playing, end) to guide the player through the ice cream creation process.

Game States and User Interaction:

	â€¢	Game States: Implemented game states to manage different stages of gameplay, such as the start screen, playing mode, and end screen. This allows for structured gameplay flow and clear transitions between game states.
	â€¢	User Interaction: Players interact with the game by clicking buttons to add scoops of ice cream. These interactions trigger changes in the ice cream cone's game state and visual appearance.

Dynamic Visuals and Reset Functionality:

	â€¢	Dynamic Visuals: Visual elements such as coloured lines and cone graphics dynamically change based on player actions and game state transitions.
	â€¢	Reset Functionality: Incorporated a reset functionality to allow players to start a new game after completing or ending the current one. This ensures a seamless and enjoyable gameplay experience.

Combining Emmaâ€™s ice cream creation game with the previous stageâ€™s space-themed environment, weâ€™ve created an engaging and interactive experience where players can explore a virtual space station and enjoy building their custom ice cream cones.
